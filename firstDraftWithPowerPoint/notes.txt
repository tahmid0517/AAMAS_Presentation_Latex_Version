Notes:
	- put the last 2 scenarios in same slide and go over it briefly
	- Make equations same size 
	- Add goal/objective side 
		- Problem Statement
	- Make clearer connection between RL and optimal control
	- Conclude with GIFs of simulations
	- Could use tables as backups slides in case anyone asks questions
	- Correct subscripts in independence and othogonality slide
	- Redundancy -> Make this clearer
